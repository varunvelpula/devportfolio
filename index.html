					<p>
						I am a first year Masters of Science in Robotics student at the University of Pennsylvania. I had previously done my undergraduate studies at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India. There, I had majored in Mechanical Engineering. My areas of interests are in the control systems and application of machine learning for robotics. I have experience and have worked on projects in the domains of manipulator, aerial and ground robotics. I am also currently interested in localization and mapping, and controls for robots.
					</p>
					<p>
						During my free time, I read books, draw and listen to music. I read a lot of non-fiction books, particularly relating to world history and current affairs. I am a massive drifting and rally racing fan. In my free time, I like to sketch designs of cars. I am very genre-fluid when it comes to my music tastes. My favorite artists/bands are the Strokes, Arctic Monkey and Prateek Kuhad.

					I am working on the ModQuad project under the guidance of Prof. Mark Yim. The problem statement is to develop a decentralized control algorithm for multi-quadcopter systems which work together in a collaborative swarm. The aim is to develop a decentralized control algorithm for the self-assembly of multi-quadcopter systems during mid-flight.
					<br><br>
					To achieve modularity, the initial stages of the project I had developed multiple moular stucture designs (cages in which the quadcopter sit in) and prototyped them through 3D prinitng and assembly of the structure.

							<h3>Integration of Motion Capture System with multiple Crazyflie 2.0 Quadcopters</h3>
							<p>
								This work was done as part of my internship after my junior year at IISc. I was tasked with the development of an experimental setup consisting of autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) to test laws of guidance such as Pure Pursuit and Good Helmsman and tracking laws based on potential vector fields. I had developed controls for the quadcopters using PID tuners for navigation of the MAVs in indoor environment using data from IMU sensor and array of motion capture cameras. Sensor fusion using Kalman filter was used to minimize noise and improve data reliability. For communication of data between MAVs, motion capture system and workstation, I had used Robot Operating System (ROS) and ROS library on Matlab.

						<h3>On effectiveness of camera on an UAV mounted search sensor</h3>
						<p>
							I had developed a model for search effectiveness of a camera for search applications using a downward facing camera mounted on an UAV. The model captures the spatial variation of the camera in terms of its effectiveness in target detection. Developed the experimental model to capture and analyze the images taken by an overhead camera to validate the model of search effectiveness for detection and correct identification of objects, using ArUCo markers and triangular shapes as targets.

						<h3>Asian Broadcasting Union (ABU) Robocon Robotics Competition</h3>
						<p>
							The ABU Robocon is a prestigious robotics competition for undergraduate students across India and Asia. I was one of the founding members of the team. In our inaugral year of participation, we won a team award for the Best Use of Matlab, which was one of the sponsorers. We had used Matlab to establish the inverse kinematic equations for the mobile robots which were using Mecanum and Omni wheel configurations. I was a part of the mechanical team which developed the design for the chassis, gripper and other key mechanisms for the robots on SolidWorks and performed kinematic analyses of the designed mechanisms.

I was part of team which was tasked with the development of a mock model of a smart city incorporating concepts in Internet of Things, sensors and sctuators, computer vision and path planning. I had developed the module and code for the detection and localization of the Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) and buildings using an overhead camera through the detection of AruCo markers

						<h3>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using GraphSLAM</h3>
						<p>
							GraphSLAM is used to generate and constantly update the environment around the robot in real time
							and localize itself in this environment. I implemented a cost effective solution by using an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and camera for obstacle detection instead of a stereo camera or a LIDAR sensor. The algorithm developed is based on GraphSLAM as described in the Udacity course on Artificial Intelligence in Robotics by Dr. Sebastian Thrun.

						<h3>Positive Drive Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)</h3>
						<p>
							I had done this project in my sophomore year. I developed a novel design of a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) incorporating positive drive. The CVT is an automatic transmission based on belt drive driven between two pulleys at different diameters. In CVT, the diameters can be adjusted dynamically to alter the speed ratio. In our implementation, positive drive is achieved using a retractable gear tooth when engaged with the steel belt. The aim of the design was to improve fuel economy, increase torque transmission and improve driving experience for truck drivers.
